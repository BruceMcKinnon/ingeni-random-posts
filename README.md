== Description ==


Ingeni Random Posts is great for quickly populating a WordPress database with random post content. This is a fantastic help when creating new WordPress themes. You can actually see how your site looks and works with a large amount of content.


The plugin randomly generates a post title, and chooses a category and author that already exist in your WordPress database. It also randomly chooses one of twenty included photos as the featured image, and creates a set of random tags.


As well as creating random posts, the plugin also allows you to bulk delete them.


== Installation ==


1. Upload the 'ingeni-random-posts' folder to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory

2. Activate the Ingeni Random Posts plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

3. Create the post Categories and Authors that you wish to use.

4. Select 'Generate Random Posts' from the 'Tools' menu in Wordpress.

5. Choose the number of posts you wish to add, then press the 'Add Random Posts' button.
